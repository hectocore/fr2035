# French Army 2035 - Arma 3 mod

**French Army 2035 (FR2035)** mod for the **Arma 3** video game.

This mod contains new scripts, configs, soundtracks, textures and more.
It brings to the base game a lore-compliant and fully operational French
faction.

It can be downloaded directly into the game from the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=621431572).

## Mod Lore
As a key actor of NATO forces, France involvement in the Mediterranean Sea
crisis keeps growing as CSAT gains more influence across Africa and middle-east.

Enroll in the French army and get ready to join one of the last pillars of the
falling European Union.

## Why is French Army 2035 Open source?
After many years of maintaining this mod as a spare-time project, I decided to
share the knowledge I acquired with anyone who's looking to create Arma 3 mods.

All the sources and materials I used are made public so everyone can adjust them
and create their own mod from it, or contribute to it.
