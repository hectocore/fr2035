# Legacy mod

This folder contains the legacy French Army 2035 mod (deprecated).

This mod is no longer available to the public and was removed from the
Steam workshop due to quality issues and bugs.

Keep in mind that this legacy mod was crafted with little to no knowledge of
computer software programming or design tools, and therefore it may contain
serious issues in terms of quality and code architecture.

Although, its content is still used as an inspiration for the new mod.
